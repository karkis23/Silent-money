-- 1. Faceless YouTube Empire
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 📺 The Global AdSense Cashcow
You don’t need a camera or a studio. Some of the highest-paid YouTubers never show their face. You are building an "Information Media Company" that generates USD revenue from India.

### 🛠️ Production Pipeline (The AI-Factory)
1. **Niche Selection (Critical)**: High CPM niches pay 5x more. Choose:
   - **Finance**: Trading strategies, credit card reviews.
   - **Luxury**: Supercars, billionaire lifestyle deep-dives.
   - **Tech**: Future of AI, space exploration (NASA/SpaceX).
2. **Scripting (Day 1)**: Use **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **ChatGPT**. Command: "Write a high-retention 10-minute script about the SpaceX Starship, focusing on $ values and scale."
3. **Audio (Day 2)**: Use **ElevenLabs (Speech-to-Speech)** for a human-natural voiceover. 
4. **Visuals (Day 3-5)**: Use **InVideo AI** or **Pictory** to find stock footage (Storyblocks/Pexels). Overlay with high-quality captions and sound effects.
5. **The "Hook" Thumbnail**: Use **Canva + Midjourney** to create high-contrast, clickable thumbnails.

### 💰 Profit Statistics
- **AdSense**: $3 - $15 per 1000 views (RPM).
- **Affiliation**: High-ticket software links.
- **Sponsorships**: $500 - $5,000 per video once you hit 100k+ views.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Monetization Desert
YouTube requires 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours to start paying. This usually takes 6-9 months of "Unpaid Labor." If you stop posting in month 3, you lose everything. You need to treat this like a factory, not a hobby.',

-- 2. Amazon Influencer Hub
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 📦 The "On-Site" Video Passive Income
This is NOT just affiliate marketing. This is the **Amazon Influencer Program**, where Amazon pays you to put videos on their own product pages.

### 🛠️ Stealth Infiltration Strategy
1. **Approval (Level 1)**: You need an active social media presence (IG/YouTube). Amazon prioritizes "Engagement Rate" over "Follower Count."
2. **The "B-Roll" Strategy (The Gold Mine)**:
   - Find products you already own that are sold on Amazon.
   - Film a 60-second vertical video (Review + How to use).
   - **Critical**: Amazon places these videos directly under the product price or in the "Videos for this product" section.
3. **The "On-Site" Commission**: When someone watches your video and stays to buy, you earn a commission. This is **ultra-passive** because Amazon provides the traffic.

### 💰 Potential Yield
- **Entry**: INR 2k - 5k/mo (10 videos).
- **Power User**: INR 40k - 1L/mo (300+ videos live).
- **Expansion**: "Gift Strategy" - brands will send you free products just to make a video for their listing.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The "Video Rejection" Wall
Amazon has a manual review process for your first 3 videos. If your audio is bad or you show a barcode/QR code, they will reject you and lock your account. You have to be meticulous about "Family-Friendly" content rules.',
    skills_required = ARRAY['Simple Video Editing', 'Product Presentation', 'Lighting Setup', 'Compliance Reading'],
    success_rate_percentage = 60

-- 3. Local SEO Consultancy
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 📍 The "Google Maps" Arbitrage
There are thousands of Dentists, Doctors, and Gyms in India that aren''t on page 1 of Google Maps. You fix that.

### 🛠️ Execution Playbook
1. **The Lead Scout (Day 1)**: Open Google Maps. Search "Dentist in [Your Area]." Find those with < 10 reviews or missing "Google Business Profile" info.
2. **The High-Value Offer**: "I will help you show up on page 1 for [keyword]... and if you don''t get new calls in 30 days, you don''t pay my management fee."
3. **The Optimization protocol**:
   - Geotag their office photos.
   - Set up automatic "Review Request" QR codes at their reception desk.
   - keyword-optimize their business description.
4. **The Retainer**: Charge INR 10,000/mo to keep their profile updated and respond to reviews.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Canva**: For GMB posts.
- **BrightLocal**: For ranking audits.
- **WhatsApp API**: For automated review requests.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Verification Trap
Google often requires a physical "Postcard with Code" or a Video Call to verify a business. If the client is lazy and doesn''t finish the verification, you can''t show results. You must manage the client as much as the SEO.',

-- 4. REIT Investing India
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 🏢 Commercial Real Estate for the Working Class
Own luxury IT parks in Bangalore and Mumbai for as low as INR 300. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are mandated by SEBI to distribute 90% of their net cash flow to investors.

### 🛠️ Selection Framework
1. **The Big 3 in India**:
   - **Embassy Office Parks**: Largest, global tenants (Cisco, IBM).
   - **Mindspace**: Strong in Pune and Hyderabad.
   - **Brookfield**: Concentrated in high-end NCR tech parks.
2. **Key Metric (Dividend Yield)**: Look for "Expected Distribution Yield" (usually 6-7% in India).
3. **Growth Metric (Capital Appreciation)**: As rents in India rise, the share price of the REIT also rises.
4. **Payout Frequency**: Quarterly distributions directly to your bank account.

### 💰 Tax-Efficient Income
REIT payouts consist of 3 parts: **Interest**, **Dividends**, and **Repayment of Debt**. Depending on the REIT’s structure, a portion of this income can be TAX-FREE in your hands.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The WFH Threat
If companies shift permanently to "Work From Home," demand for office space drops. Vacancy rates rise, rents fall, and your dividends will be cut. This is a 10-year game, not a 1-year one.',

-- 5. Homestay Management (Airbnb Proxy)
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 🏠 Hospitality Arbitrage (Zero Property Ownership)
There are thousands of beautiful, empty villas and flats in locations like Goa, Rishikesh, and Lonavala. You manage them for the owner.

### 🛠️ Operations Protocol
1. **The Contract (Day 1-15)**: Find a "Second Home" owner. Propose a "60-40" split (they keep 60%, you keep 40% after expenses) for managing the Airbnb/Booking.com listing.
2. **The Makeover (Day 15-30)**: Use a few house plants, aesthetic lighting, and professional photography. A $100 investment in "vibes" can double the nightly rate.
3. **The Tech Stack**: Use a **Channel Manager** (like Guestala or Guesty) to sync calendars and avoid double bookings.
4. **The Ground Crew**: Hire a local cleaning lady and a handyman on a "per-check-in" payment model.

### 💰 Monthly Yield Example
- **Monthly Revenue**: INR 1.5 Lakhs (15 nights dynamic pricing).
- **Your Cut (40%)**: INR 60,000.
- **Expenses (Cleaning/Staff)**: INR 15,000.
- **Net Profit**: INR 45,000 per property.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Operations Nightmare
Guests will call you at 2 AM because the Wi-Fi is slow or a tap is leaking. You are effectively running a 24/7 hotel. Unless you have a trusted local manager, you will be chained to your phone.',
