-- 1. Corporate Bond Investing
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 🏛️ The "Fixed Deposit" Killer
Lend money directly to large Indian corporations (like Tata, Reliance, or Muthoot) for better interest rates than banks. These are senior secured bonds, meaning you are first in line for payouts.

### 🛠️ Strategic Investment Protocol
1. **The Infrastructure (Day 1)**: Sync your Demat account (Zerodha/Groww) with curated platforms like **Wint Wealth** or **GoldenPi**.
2. **The "Credit Grade" Filter**: 
   - **AAA/AA+**: Highest safety, lower returns (8.5% - 9.5%).
   - **A/BBB**: Moderate risk, higher returns (11.0% - 13.0%).
3. **Maturity Alignment**: Match the bond duration with your goal (e.g., "18 Months for a car downpayment").
4. **Liquidity Check**: Only buy bonds with a "Secondary Market" presence so you can sell before maturity if needed.

### 💰 Yield Expectations
- **Target Yield**: 10.5% (Weighted Average Portfolio).
- **Minimum Start**: INR 10,000 (Varies by bond).
- **Returns**: Periodic (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual) interest credited to your bank.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Default & Call Risk
1. **Credit Default**: If a company fails, your principal is at risk. Always diversify—don''t put 100% into one company.
2. **Call Option**: Some companies have a "Call Option" where they can pay you back early if interest rates in the market drop, ending your high-yield engine prematurely.',

-- 2. Niche Affiliate Blogs
UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 🕸️ The "Digital Real Estate" Network
Build a website that solves a specific comparison problem (e.g., "Best Water Purifiers for Hard Water in India"). You earn a commission for every sale generated through your links.

### 🛠️ 90-Day Authority Blueprint
1. **The Niche Drill (Day 1-7)**: Don''t go broad. Focus on "Micro-Niches" like Home Gym Equipment, Baby Safe Toys, or Outdoor Camping Gear.
2. **The "Helpful Content" Engine**: Use **SurferSEO** or **Semrush** to find keywords with "Low Difficulty." Write 2000-word deep-dive reviews based on ACTUAL user feedback (not just specs).
3. **The Tech Stack**: WordPress + **GeneratePress** (Fastest theme) + **Cloudways** (Hosting).
4. **The Link strategy**: Join **Amazon Associates**, **Impact Radius** (for brands like Hostinger/Canva), and **Cuelinks** (for Indian e-commerce).

### 💰 Exit Value
Successful affiliate sites are sold for **30x monthly profit**.
- **Site Earning $500/mo** = **$15,000 (INR 12 Lakhs)** exit value.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Search Engine Carousel
Google launches "Core Updates" 3-4 times a year. Your traffic can drop by 50% overnight if Google decides AI-generated content or poor user experience is an issue. You must build an "Email List" to own your audience, not just rely on SEO.',

UPDATE income_ideas SET 
    full_description = '### 🎮 The "Code Multipier" Business
Build a high-quality starter kit for a specific type of app (e.g., "Food Delivery App with Flutter") and sell the source code repeatedly on global marketplaces.

### 🛠️ Production Cycle
1. **Asset Identification**: Browse **CodeCanyon** Trends. See what has 500+ sales and replicate the "Core Logic" but with better UI/UX.
2. **The "Clean Code" Pledge**: Developers buy templates to save time. If your code is messy, you will get 1-star reviews and zero sales.
3. **Marketplace Deployment**: List on **Envato Market**, **Codester**, and **SellAnyCode**.
4. **The "Upsell" Support**: Charge $50 - $200 for "Customization Services" (changing logos, colors, or adding a specific API for the buyer).

### 💰 Royalty Matrix
- **Price**: $30 - $99 per license.
- **Sales**: A top-tier template can sell 1,000+ copies over 2 years.
- **Passive Ratio**: High maintenance initially (updates), but 80% passive after 6 months.',
    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The Technical Debt Cloud
Software ages fast. If Flutter or Swift launches a major version change, your template is "Broken." You must commit to updating your code every 6 months or your income will drop to zero.',

The Indian beauty market is exploding. You brand pre-existing, lab-tested formulations as your own "Premium" line.

### 🛠️ Market Penetration Path

2. **The Branding Layer (The Only Thing That Matters)**: 
   - Hire a high-end designer for the Logo and Box design. 
   - Avoid cheap plastic; use glass or frosted finishes to command a 3x price premium.
3. **The Influencer Seed**: Send 100 free samples to "Nano-Influencers" (5k-20k followers) on Instagram/Reels.

1. **RTO (Return to Origin)**: In India, COD orders have a 20-30% RTO rate. You lose shipping costs both ways.
2. **Shelf Life**: If your product doesn''t sell in 6 months, it expires. You lose 100% of the manufacturing capital.',

2. **The Production**: record your Zoom sessions. **That is your course content.** Do not buy expensive cameras yet.
3. **The hosting**: Move to **Graphy** (Indian payment integration) or **Kajabi**.
4. **The Scaling Funnel**: Create a "Low-Ticket" entry (INR 499 Workshop) that leads to your "High-Ticket" Mastery Course (INR 15,000).

### 💰 Scale potential

    reality_check = '### ⚠️ The "Guru" Fatigue
